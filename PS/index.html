    <h2> Personal Statement</h2>

    <p>My name is Dorothy, I come from Macau, and now I am a Youth Worker Assistant under the Hong Kong Federation of Youth Groups. Before working in this social service organization, I graduated from CUHK with a Master of Arts degree in Journalism and from the University of Macau with a bachelor's degree in Sociology.</p>
    <p>Since college, I have paid close attention to disadvantaged groups in society. I am convinced that the barriers to underprivileged groups, such as poverty, disability, and females, are not the fault of individuals but the result of social structure. I've always wanted to understand the reason involved, so I actively assisted with research studies on campus, such as drug use, surplus food and disability, and got an initial understanding of how to do social research.</p>

		<p>When I was at the University of Macau, I chose The Comparison of the Concept of Disability Between Hong Kong and Macau as my final year report topic. This report only requires writing to the proposal stage. I proposed to use in-depth interviews with the policymakers and employees from NGOs and communities and text analysis of the laws, policies, and community manuals to compare the disability viewpoint of the society in Hong Kong and Macau.</p>
		<p>I agree with the explanation of the Social Model about disability, in which 'disability' is a concept constructed by society but not by 'personal sin' suggested by the Religion model nor by 'personal unluck' by the Medical Model. With a similar idea, I agree more with Radical Social Work. It criticizes Traditional Social Work, which adopts psychology to explain social issues and regards the existing social system as indisputable. I believe that social policies should guarantee that the disabled group can interact with the society rather than covering up this issue with welfare allowances in the form of alms.</p>

			<p>After my bachelor's degree, I thought it was necessary to improve my interview and writing skills, so I decided to go to CUHK to study Journalism for a master's degree. In the same year, I did an internship in media for more than one year. During my internship, I interviewed single mothers and carers under the epidemic and learned about the needs of these vulnerable groups. And now, I used my writing skills to help social enterprises publicize and write grant proposals for non-government organizations.</p>

  <div class="morewhite"><div class="inner">
		<p>I am now officially under the culture service department in HKFYG, but  I am not only supporting this unit by holding activities and providing art workshops to the school. I also support the Youth Hostel PH2  for their daily operation and the Taipo Youth SPOT for grant proposal writing. I am glad to reach three different units in the HKFYG and learn more about youth living conditions,  community development, and the logistics of holding a Territory-wide activity like the Tai'O Culture Festival.</p>
		<p>After my learning and practicing experience in the above categories, researching social issues like poverty, disability, and related social welfare became more attractive. I realized that the responsibility of supporting the disadvantaged group can not be taken all by the non government organization but should be taken by the government and even the whole society at the same time. For example, the Youth hostel can provide around 90 quotas for youth to live. However, the youth face not just house problems but also poverty, worse family relationships, and mental disorders. We should not suppose a youth hostel can solve all of this.</p>

			<p>I am trying to have a further study in Social Welfare or sociology in the future as I am determined to be devoted to social welfare and provide the disadvantaged group with the corresponding assistance.</p>
